--------
Abstract
--------

POE::Component::JobQueue manages a finite pool of worker sessions as
they handle an arbitrarily large number of tasks.  It often is used as
a form of flow control, preventing an arbitrarily large number of
worker sessions from exhausting some finite resource.

------------
Requirements
------------

This module requires POE.  This requirement is encoded in Makefile.PL,
so the CPAN shell should do the right thing.  If this is installed
without the CPAN shell, the person installing it will have to do the
right thing manually.

------------------
Basic Installation
------------------

POE::Component::JobQueue may be installed through the CPAN shell in
the usual CPAN shell manner.  This typically is:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e 'intstall POE::Component::JobQueue'

You can also read this README from the CPAN shell:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
  cpan> readme POE::Component::JobQueue

And you can install the component from the CPAN prompt as well:

  cpan> install POE::Component::JobQueue

-------------------
Manual Installation
-------------------

POE::Component::JobQueue can also be installed manually.
<ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/R/RC/RCAPUTO/> or a similarly
named directory at your favorite CPAN mirror should hold the latest
version.

Downloading and unpacking the distribution are left as exercises for
the reader.  To build and test it:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test

The test program, t/01_pools.t, makes an excellent sample program.  If
you would like to see more details about its operation, edit it and
set the DEBUG constant to any value Perl considers "true".

When you're ready to install the component:

  make install

It should now be ready to use.

Thanks for reading!
