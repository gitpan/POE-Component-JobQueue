Revision history for POE::Component::JobQueue
=============================================

Changes marked with "(!!!)" may break backward compatibility.  Changes
marked with "(???)" are just information.

Note to self: Don't forget to tag the version after a new distribution
is released.  For example: `cvs tag -Rc v1_00 .'

---------------
0.51 2001.05.29
---------------

Martijn van Beers discovered a condition where active queues would
stop polling for new work.  It turns out that a flag preventing
additional polling delays was incomplete.  His patch removed the
partial code, but that would have caused future problems.  Instead I
completed the code with a quick hack which will do the right thing but
probably needs to be made less bletcherous in the future.

---------------
0.50 2000.09.04
---------------

Initial release.  Arbitrarily versioned at 0.50 to indicate pretty
good stability but the need for some testing and refinement.

Extracted the code from a medium-sized hack I wrote to look up
addresses for long lists of domains, cleaned it up, made the interface
more useful, commented the code, documented it, and made it a module.
