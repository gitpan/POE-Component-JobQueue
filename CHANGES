    Zach Thompson reported the hash keys problem that was previously
    patched, reminding me that I hadn't actually released the fix to the
    world. Here I am bumping the version number so I can release it to
    the CPAN.

    Applied neyuki's patch to correct some typos in hash keys and
    parameter names. This also corrects the worker respond logic in
    active queues.
